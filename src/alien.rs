//! The design philosophy underlying `power_house` is pedagogical, yet mathematically rigorous.
//! Each module encapsulates a discrete concept in modern computational complexity theory,
//! illustrating how modest abstractions compose into a cohesive proof infrastructure.
//!
//! This crate aspires to bridge gaps between theoretical exposition and practical engineering,
//! serving both as a didactic resource and a foundation for future cryptographic research.
//! Blueprint for an ALIEN-like interactive proof ledger.
//!
//! The **ALIEN theorem** described in the problem statement envisions a
//! globally verifiable ledger for interactive proofs that combines
//! adaptive completeness, byzantine consensus, verifiable randomness,
//! and privacy-preserving cryptography.  While a full implementation
//! of such a system is far beyond the scope of this crate, this module
//! outlines, through comments and stub types, how one might begin to
//! construct such a ledger using the primitives provided elsewhere in
//! the crate.
//!
//! ## Conceptual Overview
//!
//! 1. **Provers and Statements**: Provers attempt to convince the ledger
//!    of statements belonging to some language `L` (e.g. PSPACE).  A
//!    prover submits a claim along with the necessary interactive proof
//!    messages.  In practice these could be STARK or SNARK proofs.
//!
//! 2. **Random Challenges via VRF**: Challenges for the interactive
//!    protocol are derived using a verifiable random function with
//!    sufficient min-entropy.  In this crate, the [`prng`](crate::prng)
//!    module demonstrates how one could derive deterministic challenges
//!    from a transcript.  A production system would use cryptographic
//!    VRFs.
//!
//! 3. **Consensus and Finality**: Validators aggregate proofs and use a
//!    Byzantine-fault-tolerant consensus protocol to achieve finality.
//!    The [`consensus`](crate::consensus) module provides a simple
//!    threshold consensus function that counts votes.  A real system
//!    would incorporate network, stake weighting and slashing conditions.
//!
//! 4. **Provability Logic**: The theorem introduces modal operators
//!    \(\_n\) and \(\lozenge\) capturing the notion of provable at
//!    level `n` and eventual finality.  A full ledger would track the
//!    level of each proof and ensure monotonicity (proofs at level `n`
//!    remain valid at level `n+1`) and finality (once finalized, proofs
//!    cannot be contradicted).
//!
//! 5. **Hybrid Post-Quantum Security**: The theorem advocates
//!    combining lattice-based and hash-based commitments along with
//!    finite-precision Bell tests and classical verification of
//!    quantum proofs.  Such features are not implemented here but
//!    illustrate directions for future work.
//!
//! ## Stub Types
//!
//! The following types are provided merely as scaffolding.  They
//! document the intended responsibilities of various components in an
//! ALIEN-like system and serve as placeholders for future expansion.
